<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive"><strong>A Space Carousel ride experience (game) in <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a> populated with flying objects. Coded By Michael McAnally, August 13, 2018 using <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> and wonderful open source javascript libraries.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>NOTE: Game and Source Code Is Free to promote the development of WebVR for all:&nbsp; (Also giving special credit and respectful thanks to all the developers of A-frame and the many Github Libraries used in this code, you know who you are and you are all seriously great coders and more!!!)</p>

<p><strong>System Requirements: VR Headset (hardware highly recommended, not required). Latest Firefox, Chrome or Edge, Samsung GearVR or Daydream? (not tested)&nbsp;</strong><strong>or HTC Vive or Oculus Go/Rift Browser supported.&nbsp; No guarantees it will stay that way . . .&nbsp; only testing can confirm functionality on any future headsets and VR platforms.</strong></p>

<p>The Game:&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://rocketvirtual.com/webvr/html/Space_Carousel_newbuild35.html">Space Carousel</a></p>

<p><a href="https://rocketvirtual.com/?q=content/things-you-need-build-simple-webvr-game-experience-aframe">Notes to Coders</a>: All done with HTML/JavaScript Code.&nbsp; That is pretty amazing, given the libraries I have used.&nbsp; Yes, I know it is a monolithic monster and collision is not prevented, but still . . . it is just too cool to not feel proud about it!&nbsp; I've made a strong effort to use royalty free stuff to respect IP (you should change the background music after 10,000 downloads, since I did purchase that).&nbsp; Please respect all intelectual propery and copyrights.</p>
